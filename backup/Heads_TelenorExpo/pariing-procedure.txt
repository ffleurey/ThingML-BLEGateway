Pairing procedure for AND-UA651 blood pressure and AND-UC325 scale
------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting the pairing parameters is a bit easier with ThingML - but since we don't have the compiler on this Raspberry - we can do it manually in the generated code.



1. Stop the medicalgw.service to free the Bluetooth controller:
   "sudo systemctl stop medicalgw.service"

2. Start the pairing program:
   "sudo /home/pi/pairing/BLE_PAIR"

3. Start the pairing procedure on the device:
   - Long press on the blood pressure
   - Button on the back for scale

4. Note the values that are printed to the console at the end of the program.
   They SHOULD be copied into pairing-info.txt for future reference.


Now - in /home/pi/medicalgw/

5. Copy the values of 'peer_ltk', 'peer_ediv', 'peer_random' into the top of:
   - ANDUA651BLEImpl.c for the blood pressure
   - ANDUC352BLEImpl.c for the scale
   There should already be some values there that you need to remove.

6. Copy the MAC address of the device into MedicalGW_cfg.c (around line 2800)

7. Compile the new executable
   "make"

8. Re-start the medicalgw.service
   "sudo systemctl start medicalgw.service"

9. Check that everything seems fine
   "sudo systemctl status medicalgw.service"



Good job! :)
